        "title": "History of Coffee",
        "image": "",

        "content": "Coffee was discovered around 850 A.D. in the part of Africa now known as Ethiopia. According to one story that has been passed down through the generations, a sheep herder named Kaldi discovered coffee as he tended his sheep. He noted that his sheep became extremely active after eating the red cherries from a plant as they went from one pasture to another.\r\n\r\nHe ate a few of the cherries himself, and was soon as overactive as his herd. The story goes on to say that a monk passed by and scolded him for \"partaking of the devil's fruit.\" However, the monks soon found themselves eating the same fruit to help them stay awake for their prayers.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the coffee plant grew naturally in Ethiopia. But once the people of Arabia became enthralled with coffee and transplanted plants to Arabia, coffee was monopolized by them. Later, countries beyond Arabia whose inhabitants believed coffee to be a delicacy guarded its secret and with caution began to siphon off coffee plants from Arabia.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian government prohibited the transportation of the plant out of the Moslem nations, so the actual spread of coffee was started illegally.\r\n\r\nIn the 17th century, Italian traders introduced coffee to the West and changed the history of coffee forever. Many Christians believed that coffee was the drink of the devil.\r\n\r\nBut in Italy, Pope Clement VIII drank and endorsed coffee against the advice of his advisors who wanted it to be considered part of the infidel threat. Because of his endorsement of coffee, it became acceptable as a Christian beverage and spread throughout the West.\r\n\r\nCoffee Houses began opening in the mid-17th century in the Western world. The first coffee house opened in Italy in 1645, in England in 1652, in Paris in 1672 and in Berlin in 1721.\r\n\r\nIn 1668, Edward Lloyd's coffee house opened in England and eventually became Lloyd's of London, the best-known insurance company in the world. By this time, coffee had replaced beer as New York's City's favorite breakfast beverage.\r\n\r\nIn the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Dutch became a prominent force in the coffee industry with a coffee plant smuggled out of the Arab port of Mocha. The Dutch cultivated coffee commercially in Ceylon and in their East Indian colony of Java, which came to be the source of coffees' nickname.\r\n\r\nHowever, the French stole a seedling and transported it to Martinique. Fifty years later, an official survey found 19 million coffee trees on Martinique, and eventually it\u2019s estimated that ninety percent of the world's coffee spread from this one seedling.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch and French monopoly was broken up in 1727 when Brazil entered the fray. Lieutenant colonel Francisco de Melo Palheta was sent by the Brazilian government to arbitrate a border dispute between the French and Dutch colonies in Guiana. Not only did he settle the disagreement, but he also began an affair with the wife of the governor of French Guiana.\r\n\r\nThe dear lady bid the lieutenant colonel adieu with a bouquet in which she hid cuttings and fertile seeds of coffee that began the Brazilian portion of the history of coffee. By 1907, Brazil accounted for 97% of the world\u2019s coffee production.\r\n\r\nAs the Industrial Revolution swept through Europe and the United States, coffee was changed forever. Hills Bros. became the first company to vacuum pack coffee, changing the coffee industry from a local one to a regional and even national one. Sanka was introduced to the United States as the first decaffeinated coffee. And Nestle learned how to freeze dry coffee and keep it fresher longer.\r\n\r\nThe most recent changes in the history of coffee come over the last sixty years. In 1946, the espresso machine was invented in Italy, giving rise to the Cappuccino.\r\n\r\nAnd in 1971, Starbucks opened its first store in Seattle\u2019s Pike Place public market. And that ladies and gentlemen is a small and brief history of coffee, which I hope you enjoyed.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\u00a9 Copyright Randy Wilson, All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nSource: Free Articles from ArticlesFactory.com\r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\r\n\r\nArticle written by Randy Wilson and brought to you by http://www.ultimate-coffees-info.com.",

        "image": "",

        "content": "The carbohydrates and fats of the coffee beans are converted into aromatic oils through the heat generated by the roasting process. Heat eliminates carbon dioxide and moisture, decomposing and boosting acids, leading to that remarkable coffee flavor.\r\n\r\n For a true connoisseur, coffee roasting is just one element for that particular flavor. The taste of a specific roast cannot be easily described because of the abundance of coffee bean types, variants and varying roasting times.\r\n\r\n Still, here are some coffee roasting basics:\r\n\r\n1. Light coffee roasting or New England or Cinnamon roast. Adjust the roaster to roughly seven minutes. The light roast is complete as the beans nearly double its original size. This is the coffee that is easily and commonly found at mass market coffee roasters. The obtained flavor is light bodied and the coffee bean is dry with a rather bitter taste.\r\n\r\n2. Medium roast coffee is commonly known as American, Regular, full City and Breakfast. For this type of roasting set the roaster to somewhere between nine and eleven minutes. Although it is not so common in stores as light roast, but it is not hard to find. Compared to light roast it has a sweeter taste delivering a cup of coffee with a more intense aroma.\r\n\r\n3. Dark coffee roasting also referred to as Continental or French roast is obtained by setting your roaster to about thirteen minutes. When the oil gets to the beans\u2019 hot surface you will hear a hissing sound. The obtained taste is sweet, spicy and pleasantly intense.\r\n\r\n4. Really dark coffee roasting is darkest coffee that can be achieved before the deterioration of the coffee bean\u2019s quality. You know this coffee roast as Italian or espresso roast. That pleasant Italian roast is obtained through fourteen to fifteen coffee roasting. The coffee beans will first hiss (because of the oil inside the beans) and then will smoke. The beans\u2019 sugar content will carbonize and caramelize leading to a full smoky flavor.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSource: Free Articles from ArticlesFactory.com\r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\r\n\r\nAre you looking for the best burr coffee grinders?

Then, the coffee is filtered with a plunger. It contains a very mild taste of coffee. Though time consuming, the process allows more control over brewing time and amount.\r\n\r\nSo, go ahead, pick your favorite flavorFind Article, and prepare yourself for a busy day of work with an energizing and delicious cuppa hot coffee in an instant!!\r\n\r\n \r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSource: Free Articles from ArticlesFactory.com\r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\r\n\r\nThe author has a grat taste on coffee.

        "content": "1. Look for the USDA seal Since 2002 any food that is at least 95% organic can be labeled with a USDA seal stating its organic authenticity.If your coffee does not have the seal it may still be organic, but the presence of the seal is a guarantee.  \r\n\r\n2. Have a taste Many organic coffee drinkers swear that their coffee has a cleaner and richer taste than its non-organic counterpart.If you are served a particularly tasty or satisfying cup of coffee, ask your host or server if they have treated you to some organically grown coffee.You may end up with an organic surprise when you hear their answer.  \r\n\r\n3. Have a smell Studies have shown that the aroma of coffee beans has a relaxing and sleep inducing effect.Organic coffee beans tend to have a purer smell than non-organic due to the vastly cleaner manner in which they are grown.Some feel that this natural growth results in an even cleaner and more relaxing aroma.The next time you have the chance, take a nice deep inhale of both and see which one relaxes you more.   \r\n\r\n4. Don't rely on the price Contrary to popular belief, organic coffee is not always pricier than regular coffee.While there is typically a higher cost involved in growing coffee organically, many specialty coffees that are grown non-organically can be much pricier.Additionally, many smaller coffee sellers do not have the name brand markups of the major players, so there is additional savings in that regard.While price may be a clue as to the lineage of the coffee you are considering purchasing, it is not a criterion on which you can solely rely.  While most consumers will be able to differentiate organic and non-organic coffee at the point of sale, this guide may help in identifying the difference in everyday life.Of course, you could always just ask for organicBusiness Management Articles, and ensure you are drinking the healthiest possible coffee option.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSource: Free Articles from ArticlesFactory.com\r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\r\n\r\nThis article was written by Domenic Carlson.\r\n",

        "content": "To make a cup of good, rich, deep flavored coffee, one does not necessarily need to have an expensive coffee maker at home, although owing one is an added advantage. You can still enjoy the most delightfully tasting your favorite drink without going to your favorite caf\u00e9 and standing in queues for your turn. If you want to know more about how this can be done\u2026read on.\r\n\r\nThe taste and aroma of a good coffee is what differentiates it from the mediocre and bad coffee. So, no matter how expensive your aeropress coffee maker is, you could still end up with bad taste of it, if the coffee you use is not good quality. This, however, does not mean that the coffeemaker is at fault. That is perfectly all right. Only you need to select, store and brew coffee in the proper ways.\r\n\r\nCoffee is obtained from the coffee beans. These are actually the seeds of the coffee plant. The fresh and ripe seeds are selected and left to dry out. When they have dried up as required, these seeds are then roasted and grounded as per the demand. The roasting process is very important. If the coffee is over roasted or under roasted, it would definitely spoil the flavor. The coffee can be dark roasted, medium roasted and roasted to order. This means, many companies offer to freshly roast coffee to match the needs of their clients. Using high quality coffee greatly impacts how it will turn out to be.\r\n\r\nThis process of roasting coffee also gives it a distinct aroma and flavor. Next, the roasted coffee seeds are grounded or sold as wholebean coffee. The coffee beans are finely grounded to make a powder. It is known as the instant coffee. It can also be partly grounded. This is the grounded coffee. The coffee beans are also sold as wholebean coffee. These are only roasted and not grounded.\r\n\r\nThese days, the custom flavors are also finding popularity among the clients as well. They can choose among nutty, fruity, floral and other spice flavors like walnut, caramel, chocolate, sage, cinnamon, lilac, tangerine etc. These are unique and offer a different tasting experience to the client.\r\n\r\nThe storage of the coffee also plays an important role on keeping it fresh. The best way is to transfer it to an air tight bag or container as soon as it is opened. You can also keep it in deep freezer to keep it tasting fresh for a long time. The coffee that is left unattended becomes stale and tastes bad.\r\n\r\nAnother way to ensure a great cup of java is by following the guidelines that come with the coffee. Every type of coffee requires special care and certain procedure to make it. The use of coffee type for coffee machines varies according to requirements. Some machines use freshly grounded coffee while others may use wholebean coffee seeds to make good coffee. There are various time periods for which they should be brewed to get the most of their flavor as well.\r\n\r\nSo, by taking these factors into consideration, you can make a delicious cup of coffee right at home.\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSource: Free Articles from ArticlesFactory.com\r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\r\n\r\nThere are several types of coffee in market.
